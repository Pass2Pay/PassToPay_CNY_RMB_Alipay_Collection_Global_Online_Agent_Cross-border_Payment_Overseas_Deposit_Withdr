Welcome to ReadMe! :owlbert:

You're on your way to building an awesome developer hub! Here's some of the things you'll want to check out.

# 📝 Customize your docs

What you're looking at right now is what we call our **Guides**. It's a free-form place to write to your heart's content! And the best part is... you aren't alone! Your users can contribute (with your approval, don't worry!) using the **[Suggested Edits](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/suggested-edits)** feature on every page. It's like GitHub Pull Requests, but for text!

Want to ease your users into it with some fancy marketing pages? You can enable a **[Landing Page](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/landing-page)**, and write as much HTML as you want to make it look like your brand.

# 🚦 Interactive API Docs

If you don't have an API, then no worries! ReadMe is great for any sort of documentation. But if you have an API, there are a few features to make your experience with ReadMe (and your users' experience with your developer hub!) a magical one:

- **Upload your OpenAPI file:** First step is to describe your API to us! If you already have an OpenAPI file, there's lots of ways to upload it in the _API Reference_ section. Our favorite is the GitHub Action, but you can use our CLI or you can upload it directly to the UI!
- **Add API Keys:** Don't make your users hunt around for API keys. You can surface their API key [right in the docs](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/personalized-docs), so they can play around with your API right inside ReadMe.
- **Add Logs:** The coolest thing about ReadMe is you can add [real-time API Logs](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/developer-dashboard) right to your docs, so you and your users can both see what's going on with their API. Trust us, it's magical!

# 📈 Know your users

One of the best ways to know if you're nailing the dev experience is checking out how your users are interacting with both your docs and API.

- **Documentation Metrics** let you see who's using your docs, what your best and worst pages are, what people are searching for and more!
- **API Metrics** are a bit harder to set up (I promise we do our best to make it painless!), but once you set this up you'll know _everything_ that's going on with your users!

# 💬 We're here to help!

ReadMe has a _ton_ of ways to make your docs the envy of any <<glossary:parliament>> (like that mouseover!). If you get stuck, [shoot us an email](mailto:support@readme.io) or use the Intercom widget on the bottom right of any page.

We're excited you're here! :blue_heart:
